    <h3><span>Project Description: </span>
        Implemented various data structures, including linked lists, stacks, and queues, using Java Swing, a popular GUI toolkit. Designed and implemented efficient algorithms for data structure operations, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, and integrated them with Swing components to create a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with data structures. Conducted extensive testing to ensure functionality and performance.
        <h3><span>My Role: </span>Developed and implemented data structure algorithms using Java, including linked lists, stacks, and queues.
            Integrated data structures with Swing components, such as buttons, lists, and text fields, to create a graphical user interface.
            Conducted extensive testing to identify and fix bugs, and optimized code for performance.</h3>

            <h3><span>Title: </span>Vehicle Monitoring System Using Arduino</h3>
            <h3><span>My Role:</span>Team Leader</h3>
            <h3><span>Project Description: </span>In many cases, drivers who are drowsy make no effort to 
                apply brake or avoid an accident. So, a system is designed 
                which senses the condition of the driver (his/her health) 
                and stops the vehicle immediately if an abnormal condition 
                of the driver is sensed to avoid accidents. In this system 
                an eye blink sensor, an alcohol sensor are interfaced to an 
                NodeMCU ESP8266. If any of these sensors senses an 
                abnormal condition of the driver, the vehicle automatically 
                slows down and stops. A buzzer is placed in the vehicle 
                which alerts the surrounding vehicles.</h3>
